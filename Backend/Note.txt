What is Backend Development ?
-Backend Development is the part of web development that focuses on creating and managing the server side, database APIs of an application.
-It is the backbone that support frontend handling, processing,storing ,and securing data that get displayed to the users.
-Backend focuses on the server side of a website or application handling the data logic and integration required to ensure smooth functionality

Role of a backend developer
Build APIs --> Manage DB --> Handle Server Side Logic

Key Components of Backend Development : 
 1)Database : USE for storing and retrieving data
 2)server : where code runs and request are processed
 3)API : it allows communication between frontend and backend
 4)Programming Languages : used to build the backend 
 5)Authentication : 

What are Shell Commands?
--Shell Commands are the instructions or inputs given to command line interpreter known as a shell to perform some specific task on a computer.
--It is use to direct interact with the operating system through the terminal .
--By using shell commands we can create folder, files, delete folder and files also we can copy files from one folder to another without using a mouse.

Types of shell
--There are 4 types of Shell
1)BASH - Bone Again Shell 
2)ZSH - Z Shell (MAC)
3)Power Shell (Windows)
4)FISH - Friendly Interactive Shell

Node JS:
--Its a JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
--It is an open source cross platform JavaScript runtime environment that runs on chromes V8 Engine.
--Node JS is known for its non-blocking I/O, Event driven architecture making it great for building scalable high performance

Node JS Architecture :
1-Event Driven
2-Single Threaded /non-blocking I/O
--It handle multiple connections using a single thread via the event loop and callback.
--Operations like reading files ,databases or network calls do not block execution. 
--Instead callback, promise, async await and else completion.

Node REPL(Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop)
--It is an interactive shell in NodeJS, that allows to execute JavaScript code line by line and see immediate results.
--It is useful for quick testing, debugging and learning where JavaScript code can be experimented with directly.

How it Works ?
--Read :It takes the user input
--Evaluate :It evaluate the code immediately in the same line
--Print :It Shows the output or result
--LOOP :It waits for the next input until the user exits
--To start Node REPL open terminal or cmd type (node) and press enter
--To Exit we can use (.exit)
--And to clear Environment (.clear)

Module :
--A module in NodeJS is self contained unit of code placed in a file or folder ,capable of exporting functionality for use elsewhere.
--Modules prevent global name space pollution help organising code and improve maintainability

There are three types of modules
1-BuiltIn Modules-Included with JS
2-Local Modules -User defined or created by developers as a part of project
3-External Modules - Installed via npm and stored in'node_modules'folder


Modules in NodeJS:-
--Node uses a powerful module system to help organise code, promote reuse and encapsulate functionality of node js application structure.
--There are two primary systems in nodejs
 1.CommonJS Modules and
 2.ES6/ECMA Script Modules

CommonJS Module System:-
--It is a traditional module system in node.js. It uses require() method  to import module and "module.export" or export functionality.
--Each module or file wrap in a function exposing module, exports, require.
--__filename and __dirname for local scope ensuring variable donot link into global scope.

ES6/ECMA Script Modules:-
--ES6 is the modern standardise utilising import and export. 
--modules are loaded asynchronously for better performance.
--we have to use type -> module in package.js to enable ES6.

Node.js path module :
--The node js path module is a built in module used to work with files and directory across different operating system ,allowing seamless cross platform development and file manipulation task.
--path module helps handle differences in path format between operating system
--it is used for manipulating ,joining,resolving,and normalising path  in model  application

Path Module: (method)
-> path.resolve():- Resolves an absolute path from relative segments.
-> path.basename():- Gets the last part of a path.
-> path.dirname():- It return the directory name of a path.
-> path.extname():- It returns the file extension.
-> path.isAbsolute():- It checks path is absolute or not.

--To use path module in NodeJS, we have to import it .

NodeJS FileSystem(fs):
--NodeJS filesystem(fs) module enables file and directory I/O operations offering both sysnchronous and asynchronous methods to handle files efficiently in different scenario.

Use of fs module :
--The NodeJs fs module is a core part of NodeJS, that allows programm to interact with the computer's filesystem.
--Its primary use is to perform essential file and diectory Operations such as reading writting creating deleting and monitoring files. 

Synchronous Method :
--Sysnchronous method block execution until the operation completes, making other process wait, which can be inefficient for I/O bound task.
--Some common sysnchronous method :-
     ---fs.readFileSync()
     ---fs.appendFileSync()
     ---fs.mkdirSync()
     ---fs.existsSync()
     ---fs.writeFileSync()
     ---fs.renameSync()

Asynchronous Method :
--Asynchronous method do not block execution instead they use callbacks, promises or async-await allowing other Operations to run curently and improving for heavy I/O workload.
--These are preffered for sckelble eye-performance  application or server
--Some common sysnchronous method :-
     ---fs.unlink()
     ---fs.readFile()
     ---fs.appendFile()
     ---fs.exits()
     ---fs.rename()

CLI(Command Line Interface):
--CLI means interacting with your programm through the terminal instead of the browser or GUI(graphical user interface).
--In nodeJS we can create CLI tools that accept commands, arguments, options like npm or npx.

HTTP Server(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol):
--An HTTP server is programm taht listens for request from clients and sends back response(like web page or data).
--In NodeJS we can easily create an HTTP server using the builtin HTTP module. 
--client and browser sends a request like URL,then server listens on a specific port no and then the server processes the request and sends back a responds like html, text or json

http module ---> http server --->request --->response
         
          = request----->http server--->response

Steps to create https server in nodejs :-
Step 1: we have to import http module  either by using require() or import statement.

const http=require('http')
--The http module provides methods to create and manage servers.

Step 2: create a server by using creatServer()

const server = http.creatServer((req,res)=>{
     res.writeHead(200,('Content-Type': 'test/plain'));
     res.end("message");
})

req-> Request object which contains data from client side
res-> Response object which is used to send data to client
writeHead()->it is a method which is used to define the header or set the status code and content type.
end()->it is is a method which is used to send data to client side

Step 3: Listen/Start the server by using listen()
--we need to pass a port  number as an argument to the listen() to run the server on a specific port.

server.listen(3000,()=>{
     log("Server running at http://localhost:3000")
})

--Port number can be anything in between 1024 and 6555(e.g: 3000,5000,8000)
--Now we can open our browser and go to the URL to see the Response


Some Important Request Properties
req.url : the path requested by client side
e.g : /about , /contact

req.methods : it is the http method used to check request type 
e.g: GET,POST,PUT

req.headers : it contains all request headers
e.g : {host : 'localhost.....'} 

Important Response Properties :
res.writeHead(statusCode,header): It is used to set the HTTP status code and response header.

res.write(data) : It is used to send data in Chunks

res.end([data]) : sends response, and it must be called


COMMON HTTP STATUS CODE
200 -> ok -> Request successful
201 -> created -> Data created
400 -> Bad Request -> Invalid Request 
401 -> Unauthorized -> No Authentication
403 -> Forbidden -> Access denied
404 -> Not found -> Page Not found
500 -> Internal server error -> server crashed


Express :
Express is a light weight nodejs framework design to make the development of server side applications straight forward by providing inbuilt methods for routing ,handling http request/response and intigrating middle ware easily
--Express is a minimalist web application framework built on nodejs which is primarily use to simplify the process of creating web servers.
--Express is flexible and fast which enables developers to built both small and large applications.
--It is commonly used to create APIs, web application and handling various http methods.

Use of Express :
--Built Web App and API using routing and middleware
--Reduces boilerplate code and coding time compare to VANILA nodeJS
--Organises functionality with middleware for tasks like authentication, login, and errorhandling
--It allows rapid development of scalable and maintainable web application

Differences between Express and nodejs
--Routing :(NodeJS) -> In nodejs manual setup mode code require
           (Express) -> Clean and builtIn routing system

--JSON Parsing :(NodeJS) -> manual or 3rd party
                (Express) -> simple by using Express.json()

--Middleware :(NodeJS) -> needs 3rd party library
              (Express)-> BuiltIn and systematic  middleware support

HOW to create an Express project ?
--To create an Express project firstly we need nodejs Installed with npm
--And then Install the Express package using npm
--After that we have to setup our application step by step

Route of create and express project
step 1 -Initialize project 
Open terminal and run the command to initialize npm 
-> npm init -y

step 2 -Install express
Install express via npm
->npm install express

step 3 - Create server files
Create a file named index.js or server.js as mentioned in your package.json file.
The file should be present in root directory of the project.

step-4 -Import express module and initialize the express.
const express=require('express')
const app=express()

step-5 -Define a port and start/listen the server
const PORT=8000
app.listen(PORT,()=>{
     console.log("Server running")
})

Understanding request and response in Express :-
request: It represents the http request and contains data sent by the client including path parameters, query strings body data, headers and more. 
response : It represents http response that an express app sends back to the client, it provides methods to send data like 
     res.send(), res.json(), res.status()......etc 

app.get("/",(req,res)=>{
    res.send("This is an example of response")
    console.log(req.method)
})     

Routes in express:-
--Routing defines how an applications end point respond to client requset 
--Express uses method like get(), post(), put(), delete() etc to define routes according to http methods.
--Routes consist of a path and a callback func with req and res parameters.
--There are 2 types of routes :  normal route and parameterized route 
 for ex:-  
app.get("/books",(req,res)=>{
     res.send("normal route")
}) 
app.get("/books/:id",(req,res)=>{
    res.send("parameterized route")   
})

Route Parameter:
--Route parameters are dynamic segments in the url path defined by using a single column(/books/:id),it allows capturing value directly from the url which are than accecible by using req.params in express
  for Ex:
  app.get("/books/:id",(req,res)=>{
    res.send(parameterized route ${req.params.id})   
  }) 

--In express multiple parameters are allowed.
--Route parameters are used to select a specific resource like fetching a specific user by id.


QUERY STRING
--Query strings are key value pairs appended to the end of a url after a queustion mark (?)
  e.g: ?price=10000&color=red
--In express query string are accessed in express via req.query object
  e.g: app.get('/search',(req,res)=>{
     res.send(Search for: ${req.query.q})
})

--Query string are used to filtering data ,searching or providing additional parameters to a request.

Route Chaining: 
--Route Chaining allows defining multiple http methods for a single route using app.rout()
--It keeps route dclarations organised especially when handling different operation on one path. 
e.g app.route('/books')
    .get((req,res)=>{...})
    .post((req,res)=>{...})
    .put((req,res)=>{...})
    .delete((req,res)=>{...})

JSON
--JSON stands for JavaScript object Notation.
--It is a light weight text based data format for representig structured Data.
--It uses key value pairs and it easy for both humans and machines to read or generate. 
--It is used for data exchange between client and server in webapplications.
e.g {
      "name": "manas";
      "age": 25 ;
    }
--In JSON format keys are also written in doublecot("").

Use of JSON in Web Development:-
--APIs typically send and recieve data in JSON format beacuse it is a language independent and supported by most programming languages. 
--In express res.json(data) sends a JSON response while middleware like express.json()  and else incoming json request
--Some common use cases are sending user data,configuration or the result of database query to the client.

Q.1 What is the role of a middleware?
 It is handle req and res  between the user and server.

#MiddleWare:-
-It is a function or software layer that sits between the request and response cycle in web applications in framework like Express which enable developer to add ,modify and handle functionalities for incoming request before they reach the final route handler.
-It acts as an intermediate between frontend and backend for communication ,requesting ,handling,logging ,security and more.
-In simpe we can say it is a function that receives request,response and the next callback as an argument which allows executing codes and make changes to request and request respond object.

//Use of MiddleWare:
-MiddleWare is wideely used for tasks such as authentication,login,error handling,passing request body and adding custom headers.
-Some common built in and third party MiddleWare are expess.json(),customlogger(),course().
-MiddleWare can be applied globally by using app.use() or to specific route by using app.get()/ app.post().

#What is Next()?
-The next() in MiddleWare passes control to the other MiddleWare function in the stack.
-If a MiddleWare does not end the request respond cycle  it must call th enext() otherwise the request will hang and not be processed futher.

#Types of MiddleWare:-
1)Build in MiddleWare
2)Third-party MiddleWare
3)custom MiddleWare
4)Application-level MiddleWare
5)Router-level MiddleWare

#EXPRESS ROUTER:-
-It is a feature in express.js that allows us to create modular and mountable route handlers acting like a mini express application for specific part of API.
-It helps us to organised routes into separates files like /users, /products, /login
so large app stay clean ,reusable and easy to maintain.
-Express.router() create a separate router pbject or variable that can have its own routes and MiddleWare similar to the main app.

#STATIC FILES IN EXPRESS:-
-Express provide a built-in MiddleWare express.static() to serve static file from a folder such as public or assest.
-Static file in express are files like image, css, client side javascript, pdf, etc that are sent to the browser without any server-side processing.
-By using static() any file inside public folder becomes directly accessible by its path.
-We can mount multiple static folders or add a url prefix like app.use('/assest',express.static('public')) to serve file under a specific route segment.

#What is ejs?
-ejs stands for embedded javascript which is a template engine that lets us write html pages with javascript to generate dynamic content.
-ejs template page uses <%=variable%> to display values into html and <% %> to write javascript logic such loop, conditions inside the template file.
-To enable ejs we need to install ejs module and write the below syntax
app.set("view engine","ejs");
app.set("views", path.join(__dirname,"views"))
-Once configure by using the above syntax express will automatically look for the template inside the views folder and ejs will render them when res.render() is called.

#SERVER-SIDE RENDERING WITH Ejs:-
-----------------------------------
-With server-side rendering a route handler call res.render('templateName,{data}) and ejs combine the template with the data to produce complete html page on the server.
-Ejs handle dynamic html views while express.static() serve supoorting assest like css and javascript use by the views.
-The most common structure for view folder for ejs template and public folder for static file.
