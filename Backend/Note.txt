What is Backend Development ?
-Backend Development is the part of web development that focuses on creating and managing the server side, database APIs of an application.
-It is the backbone that support frontend handling, processing,storing ,and securing data that get displayed to the users.
-Backend focuses on the server side of a website or application handling the data logic and integration required to ensure smooth functionality

Role of a backend developer
Build APIs --> Manage DB --> Handle Server Side Logic

Key Components of Backend Development : 
 1)Database : USE for storing and retrieving data
 2)server : where code runs and request are processed
 3)API : it allows communication between frontend and backend
 4)Programming Languages : used to build the backend 
 5)Authentication : 

What are Shell Commands?
--Shell Commands are the instructions or inputs given to command line interpreter known as a shell to perform some specific task on a computer.
--It is use to direct interact with the operating system through the terminal .
--By using shell commands we can create folder, files, delete folder and files also we can copy files from one folder to another without using a mouse.

Types of shell
--There are 4 types of Shell
1)BASH - Bone Again Shell 
2)ZSH - Z Shell (MAC)
3)Power Shell (Windows)
4)FISH - Friendly Interactive Shell

Node JS:
--Its a JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
--It is an open source cross platform JavaScript runtime environment that runs on chromes V8 Engine.
--Node JS is known for its non-blocking I/O, Event driven architecture making it great for building scalable high performance

Node JS Architecture :
1-Event Driven
2-Single Threaded /non-blocking I/O
--It handle multiple connections using a single thread via the event loop and callback.
--Operations like reading files ,databases or network calls do not block execution. 
--Instead callback, promise, async await and else completion.

Node REPL(Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop)
--It is an interactive shell in NodeJS, that allows to execute JavaScript code line by line and see immediate results.
--It is useful for quick testing, debugging and learning where JavaScript code can be experimented with directly.

How it Works ?
--Read :It takes the user input
--Evaluate :It evaluate the code immediately in the same line
--Print :It Shows the output or result
--LOOP :It waits for the next input until the user exits
--To start Node REPL open terminal or cmd type (node) and press enter
--To Exit we can use (.exit)
--And to clear Environment (.clear)
