What is Backend Development ?
-Backend Development is the part of web development that focuses on creating and managing the server side, database APIs of an application.
-It is the backbone that support frontend handling, processing,storing ,and securing data that get displayed to the users.
-Backend focuses on the server side of a website or application handling the data logic and integration required to ensure smooth functionality

Role of a backend developer
Build APIs --> Manage DB --> Handle Server Side Logic

Key Components of Backend Development : 
 1)Database : USE for storing and retrieving data
 2)server : where code runs and request are processed
 3)API : it allows communication between frontend and backend
 4)Programming Languages : used to build the backend 
 5)Authentication : 

What are Shell Commands?
--Shell Commands are the instructions or inputs given to command line interpreter known as a shell to perform some specific task on a computer.
--It is use to direct interact with the operating system through the terminal .
--By using shell commands we can create folder, files, delete folder and files also we can copy files from one folder to another without using a mouse.

Types of shell
--There are 4 types of Shell
1)BASH - Bone Again Shell 
2)ZSH - Z Shell (MAC)
3)Power Shell (Windows)
4)FISH - Friendly Interactive Shell

Node JS:
--Its a JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
--It is an open source cross platform JavaScript runtime environment that runs on chromes V8 Engine.
--Node JS is known for its non-blocking I/O, Event driven architecture making it great for building scalable high performance

Node JS Architecture :
1-Event Driven
2-Single Threaded /non-blocking I/O
--It handle multiple connections using a single thread via the event loop and callback.
--Operations like reading files ,databases or network calls do not block execution. 
--Instead callback, promise, async await and else completion.

Node REPL(Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop)
--It is an interactive shell in NodeJS, that allows to execute JavaScript code line by line and see immediate results.
--It is useful for quick testing, debugging and learning where JavaScript code can be experimented with directly.

How it Works ?
--Read :It takes the user input
--Evaluate :It evaluate the code immediately in the same line
--Print :It Shows the output or result
--LOOP :It waits for the next input until the user exits
--To start Node REPL open terminal or cmd type (node) and press enter
--To Exit we can use (.exit)
--And to clear Environment (.clear)

Module :
--A module in NodeJS is self contained unit of code placed in a file or folder ,capable of exporting functionality for use elsewhere.
--Modules prevent global name space pollution help organising code and improve maintainability

There are three types of modules
1-BuiltIn Modules-Included with JS
2-Local Modules -User defined or created by developers as a part of project
3-External Modules - Installed via npm and stored in'node_modules'folder


Modules in NodeJS:-
--Node uses a powerful module system to help organise code, promote reuse and encapsulate functionality of node js application structure.
--There are two primary systems in nodejs
 1.CommonJS Modules and
 2.ES6/ECMA Script Modules

CommonJS Module System:-
--It is a traditional module system in node.js. It uses require() method  to import module and "module.export" or export functionality.
--Each module or file wrap in a function exposing module, exports, require.
--__filename and __dirname for local scope ensuring variable donot link into global scope.

ES6/ECMA Script Modules:-
--ES6 is the modern standardise utilising import and export. 
--modules are loaded asynchronously for better performance.
--we have to use type module in package.js to enable ES6.

Node.js path module :
--The node js path module is a built in module used to work with files and directory across different operating system ,allowing seamless cross platform development and file manipulation task.
--path module helps handle differences in path format between operating system
--it is used for manipulating ,joining,resolving,and normalising path  in model  application

Path Module: (method)
-> path.resolve():- Resolves an absolute path from relative segments.
-> path.basename():- Gets the last part of a path.
-> path.dirname():- It return the directory name of a path.
-> path.extname():- It returns the file extension.
-> path.isAbsolute():- It checks path is absolute or not.

--To use path module in NodeJS, we have to import it .

NodeJS FileSystem(fs):
--NodeJS filesystem(fs) module enables file and directory I/O operations offering both sysnchronous and asynchronous methods to handle files efficiently in different scenario.

Use of fs module :
--The NodeJs fs module is a core part of NodeJS, that allows programm to interact with the computer's filesystem.
--Its primary use is to perform essential file and diectory Operations such as reading writting creating deleting and monitoring files. 

Synchronous Method :
--Sysnchronous method block execution until the operation completes, making other process wait, which can be inefficient for I/O bound task.
--Some common sysnchronous method :-
     ---fs.readFileSync()
     ---fs.appendFileSync()
     ---fs.mkdirSync()
     ---fs.existsSync()
     ---fs.writeFileSync()
     ---fs.renameSync()

Asynchronous Method :
--Asynchronous method do not block execution instead they use callbacks, promises or async-await allowing other Operations to run curently and improving for heavy I/O workload.
--These are preffered for sckelble eye-performance  application or server
--Some common sysnchronous method :-
     ---fs.unlink()
     ---fs.readFile()
     ---fs.appendFile()
     ---fs.exits()
     ---fs.rename()

CLI(Command Line Interface):
--CLI means interacting with your programm through the terminal instead of the browser or GUI(graphical user interface).
--In nodeJS we can create CLI tools that accept commands, arguments, options like npm or npx.

HTTP Server(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol):
--An HTTP server is programm taht listens for request from clients and sends back response(like web page or data).
--In NodeJS we can easily create an HTTP server using the builtin HTTP module. 
--client and browser sends a request like URL,then server listens on a specific port no and then the server processes the request and sends back a responds like html, text or json

http module ---> http server --->request --->response
         
          = request----->http server--->response

Steps to create https server in nodejs :-
Step 1: we have to import http module  either by using require() or import statement.

const http=require('http')
--The http module provides methods to create and manage servers.

Step 2: create a server by using creatServer()

const server = http.creatServer((req,res)=>{
     res.writeHead(200,('Content-Type': 'test/plain'));
     res.end("message");
})

req-> Request object which contains data from client side
res-> Response object which is used to send data to client
writeHead()->it is a method which is used to define the header or set the status code and content type.
end()->it is is a method which is used to send data to client side

Step 3: Listen/Start the server by using listen()
--we need to pass a port  number as an argument to the listen() to run the server on a specific port.

server.listen(3000,()=>{
     log("Server running at http://localhost:3000")
})

--Port number can be anything in between 1024 and 6555(e.g: 3000,5000,8000)
--Now we can open our browser and go to the URL to see the Response


Some Important Request Properties
req.url : the path requested by client side
e.g : /about , /contact

req.methods : it is the http method used to check request type 
e.g: GET,POST,PUT

req.headers : it contains all request headers
e.g : {host : 'localhost.....'} 

Important Response Properties :
res.writeHead(statusCode,header): It is used to set the HTTP status code and response header.

res.write(data) : It is used to send data in Chunks

res.end([data]) : sends response, and it must be called


COMMON HTTP STATUS CODE
200 -> ok -> Request successful
201 -> created -> Data created
400 -> Bad Request -> Invalid Request 
401 -> Unauthorized -> No Authentication
403 -> Forbidden -> Access denied
404 -> Not found -> Page Not found
500 -> Internal server error -> server crashed
