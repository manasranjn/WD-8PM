MongoDB:-
========
->Mongodb is a Nosql documnent database. that store data has json document inside collections.
->Documents are like json object key value pairs and can contain nested document and arrays providing a schema-less starcuture.
->The core features includes flexible schema indexing for first queries horizontal scaling, high avalaibility and aggrigation for data processing.
->We can perform basic operatin like CRUD operation that is insert,find,update,delete documnet.

Mongoose:-
=========
mongoose is an object data modeling (ODM) library for nodejs used to starcuture and validate data when working with mongodb.
->it is a data supervised.
->it create schema means structure for our data.
->it is used to define the rules to create data models.
->also it provides methods to ineract with data.
e.g:-find(), updateOne(), create(), findOne(), etc..

Difference between mongodb and Mongoose
---------------------------------------
mdb->it is a nosql documnet database server.
m->it is an ODM library for nodejs.
mdb->it stores and manage data by using queries,indexing .
m->it is used to create data model validate and organized data while using mongoDB.
mdb->it can run alone as a database.
m->it can not work without mongoDB.it only helps interact with mongoDB.

why using mongoDB without using mongoose riking in large app?
->using mongoDB directly in  large app is not wrong but it is risky if we do not build strong partend , validation ,structure and consistency that odm like mongoose 
will provide.
->mongoDB is schema flexible so diiferent document in same collection can silently and off with missing fields ,wrong times or inconsistency structure.

##Some common terms of mongoDB and mongoose
(i)Database:-it is a container group related data in mongoDB.
->one mongoDB server can host many databases each database contains multiple collections.
(ii)Collection:-a collection is a group of document inside a database simillar to a table.
->collection are schema flexible that is document in the same collection can have different fields and structure.
(iii)Document:-the basic data record in mongoDB stored in BSON (binary json).
->a document is set of field value pairs like json object.
(iv)schema:-A defination of the structure of data that is fields types and constraints for Documents.
mongoDB itself is schema flexible but schemas are used to keep data consistent.
(v)Model:-In Mongoose a model is a compiled class created from a schema. it represents a collection and provides method to create read,update,delete documnet 
that follws in the schema.
(vi)ODM(object data model):-A programming layer that maps application object to database documnet for mongoDB.
->it provides scema, model ,validation and help us for nodejs and mongoDB.
(vii)_id:-it is special field that uniqly identifies each document in a collection.
->it is created automatically if not provided by default .
->it is used to serch data uniqly.


Common methods of mongoose:-
----------------------------
->Mongoose methods are the function provide a mongoose model and documnet to perform operation like CRUD validation aganist mongoDB .
->this methods lets such ineract with collection in an object oriented way instead of writing raw code.

Types of mongoose methods:-
---------------------------
1.Static methods:-it is also called as model methods this method called on the model itself and usually operate on many document.
e.g: user.find()
2.Instance methods:-This is also known as documnet called on a specific documnet instance and operate on that one document.
e.g: user.save()

## Static methods:-
(i)model.create(data):it create and save a new document.
(ii)model.find(filter):-it read multiple document that matches a queries and returns documents.
(iii)model.findOne(filter):-it read the first document that matches a queries.
(iv)model.finfById(id):-it read a documnet by it's  _id.
(v)model.findByIdAndUpdate(id, update):-it reads a document and update by it's id.
(vi)model.updateOne(filter, update), model.updateMany(filter, update):-it update a matching documnet based on its queries.
(vii)model.findByIdAndDelete(id):-deletes a documnet by it's id.
(viii)model.deleteOne(filter), model.deleteMany(filter):-it delete matching document based on its queries.
(ix)model.countDocuments(filter):it count the matching document

## Some Instance methods:-
(i)doc.save():it save new or modify doc and runs validation and middleware.
(ii)doc.remove()/deleteOne():it delete a specific document inside a collection.
(iii)doc.validate(),doc.validateSync():-it runs schema validation without saving .
(iv)doc.toObject()/doc.toJSON():-converts a mongoose document to a palne javascript object for response

//How to create and get the mongo db connection string?

-The mongo db connection string in uri used by our app to connect to mongo db .
-We can create and get the connection  string in two ways:
1)From mongo db atlast:-
-Create a project and a cluster atlas that had a database user and a ip access then click "connect your application" and select the drive method .
-Now we have to set user name ,password and db name and one it done we will click on "continue/create".
-And then copy the uri from step 3 .
2)Local mongoDB-
-Install and start mongo db in your machine by default it listen on local host port number 27017.according to the port number the typical connection string looks like mongodb://localhost:27017/dataBasename


mongodb+srv://manasranjanbera:u8uWFJKVSLYOnYoS@server1.wgkspjs.mongodb.net/?appName=Server1
mongodb+srv://user1:DAgT1ZQPhguJOhs5@server1.wgkspjs.mongodb.net/?appName=Server1

#CLUSTER:-
----------
-A mongodb cluster is a mongodb server that provides features like readundency, availability and scalibility.
-In atlas a cluster is a manager database deployment that we have created, it can be scale vertically or horizontally.

//STEPS TO CREATE AN EXPRESS SERVER FOR MONGODB:-
1)Create a project folder and init project
-npm init -y

2)Install required packages
-npm i express mangoose dotenv

3)Create a basic express server and start the server

4)Store mongodb uri (connection stream) in .env (in env file everything should be in capital)
-MONGO_URI = 'LINK'

5)Load it in server file 
-require('dotenv').config();
const URI=process.env.MONGO_URI;

6)Connect mongo db by using mangoose.
 mongoose.connect(URI)
    .then((res) => {
        console.log("DB Connected");
    }).catch((err) => {
        console.log(err.message);
    })

(optional)    
8)Define schema and model by using mangoose
-const taskSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
    {
        title: {
            type: String,
            required: true
        },
        completed: {
            type: String,
            default: false
        }
    },
    {
        timestamps: true
    }
)
const Task = mongoose.model('ModelName', taskSchema)
